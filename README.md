A simple prototype of an accounting app, made with React using hooks. I will push updates (styling, routing, more functionality) for this project as the time allows. The frontend communicates with the private REST API. If you want to run the app you must provide an environment variable `REACT_APP_SERVICE_BASE_URL` as well as customize the endpoints.
